7. What is the size of a C structure? How the size of a C structure is calculated?

Ans:- The size of a C structure is the sum of the sizes of all its members, possibly with some padding added to meet alignment requirements. The size of a C structure is determined by the sum of the sizes of its members. Padding may be added by the compiler between members to ensure proper alignment. The size of each member is determined by its data type, which can be obtained using the 'sizeof' operator. Bit-fields can also be used within a structure, and their size is determined by the number of bits they contain. The order in which members are declared can also affect the size of the structure due to padding. Overall, the size of a structure is important to consider for memory allocation and optimization purposes.
